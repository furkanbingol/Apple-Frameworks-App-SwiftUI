// Classes are reference types, structs are value types. We need our "viewModel" to be a reference type so it preserves it's state as it updates and changes.
// The ObservableObject protocol is a class protocol, so anything conforming to ObservableObject must be a class as well.
// ObservableObject --> Because of broadcasting!
